	<h1>2. About our mobile and web application</h1>
	<div class="newtext">
 <p> The Mobile and Web Application is intended to be a platform to document experiences of sexual violence in public and private spaces. You will  report such incidents anonymously. All information on the Mobile and Web Application is crowd-sourced and based on public user experiences. The crowd-sourced information is aggregated as hot spots on a map indicating trends at a local level. The idea behind this Mobile and Web Application is to make this crowd-sourced information useful for individuals, local communities and local administrations to identify factors and/or  locations that highlight behaviour that may lead to public violence and also to work on strategies for solutions.</p>
 <p>We may provide general information on the Mobile and Web Application that we consider may be useful to you, such as laws regarding sexual assault, relevant helpline details and details of  relevant non-profit organisations and law enforcement resources. This is for general informational purposes only, and we do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information we provide on the Mobile and Web Application. You understand that we do not and will not do any of the following:
</p>
<p class="newside">(a) provide advocacy services on behalf of end users; </p>
<p class="newside">(b) provide professional legal advice suited for your situation;
</p>
<p class="newside">(c) get immediate help for you in an emergency;</p>
<p class="newside">(d) contact or liaise with law enforcement on your behalf; </p>
<p class="newside">(e) report any specific incidents to law enforcement agencies on behalf of any end users; or
</p>
<p class="newside">(f) identify any end users or alleged perpetrators on the Mobile and Web Application.

 <p> We do not require you to reveal your name and identity. We do collect age, gender and other details of the incident but not personal, identifiable information.
